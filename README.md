# BIOMI6300-Project1

## Project name:

The discovery of factors that potentially affect childhood stunting prevalence

## Background description & goal:

Childhood stunting is a global public health issue. By looking at the childhood stunting data set downloaded from WHO website, this project is aimed at discovering the factors that could affect the prevalence of childhood stunting. Potential factors include geographic locations, family income, education level of the mother, gender, etc.

## Findings:

There is a significant difference in national prevalence of childhood stunting when it comes to geographic regions and incomes.

There is no significant difference in stunting prevalence between male and female children, or between children who live in urban areas and rural areas.

## This project includes:

**Data folder :** The data set I downloaded from WHO website.

**Figure folder :** All the plots generated in this project.

**Analysis folder :** The R markdown file that contains all the codes I wrote for the data analysis and plotting.
